# Productivity Dashboard 

A feature-rich productivity dashboard built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project helped me level up my JavaScript skills by writing most of the code independently.

##  Features

###  Real-time Information
- **Live Clock** - Current time updates every second
- **Weather Display** - Real-time weather conditions for Noida fetched from API
- **Date Tracker** - Shows current date and day of the week

###  Task Management
- **To-Do List** - Write tasks, click "Add Task" to save them, click "Task Completed" to remove
- **Day Planner** - Plan your entire day hour-by-hour from 6 AM to 12 AM (Midnight)
- **Auto-Save** - All tasks and schedules are stored in localStorage, so they persist even after closing the browser

###  Focus & Productivity
- **Pomodoro Timer** - 25-minute focused work sessions
- **Break Timers** - Short breaks and long breaks to help you recharge
- **Simple Controls** - Easy start/stop functionality

###  Daily Motivation
- **Random Quotes** - Get a fresh inspirational quote with author name every time you visit
- **API-Powered** - Quotes fetched from a free motivational quotes API

###  Personalization
- **Theme Switcher** - Multiple color schemes available
  -  **Note:** Color palettes are currently being improved. Recommend sticking with the default pink theme for the best experience!

##  Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Weather API
- Quotes API
- LocalStorage for data persistence

##  Learning Journey

This was my first substantial JavaScript project. While following Cohort 2.0 by Sarthak Sharma, I challenged myself to write ~60% of the code independently rather than copying. The To-Do and Day Planner features were built with guidance, while the Pomodoro Timer and Motivation page were designed and coded entirely by me.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/sohamghadai42/Productivity-Dashboard.git]
```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser

3. Start being productive!

**Tip:** Use the default theme for the best visual experience while I work on improving the color options!

##  Future Improvements

-  Better color palettes for theme switcher
-  Goals page design and implementation
-  Task analytics and insights
-  Export/import functionality

##  Acknowledgments

- Cohort 2.0 by Sarthak Sharma for the foundation
